      <h1>The Plan</h1>
      <p>Join us as we learn all about full stack web development. From scratch. For free. Our plan is to have learnt and practiced enough to be job ready within 1 year.</p>

      <p>We have recently found an online <a href="#">curriculum</a>, which makes use of a huge number of free online courses/lectures/documents and goes about teaching a total beginner enough to be job ready. We have just started the course, it has been a blast so far and we wanted to spread the word and form a study group in Hanoi.

        <p>Personally I have no past experience in Web/Computers/Design but am confident that if I am part of an active study group and with the wealth of online support available, I will be able to achieve my goal of finishing the course by December 2015.

          <p>So far people that we know are taking the course right now, in Hanoi, range in skill and experience as well as motivation:
            <ul>
              <li>Career change</li>
              <li>Opening up additional career options</li>
              <li>Personal projects</li>
              <li>Personal interest</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Whatever your motivation, if you have ever had an inclination to learn how to build websites, then this could be a perfect opportunity.

       <h1>The Curriculum</h1>

    <p><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses?ref=home">The Odin Project</a> was developed around a year ago, and makes use of a wide variety of free resources from around the web.  As far as I have found it is the most extensive online curriculum for learning web development of its kind.   </p>
      
      <p>A quick <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=the+odin+project">Google search</a> of The Odin Project will reveal a load of information and positive reviews of the project.  Due to its popularity, there will also be a wealth of information and support available from people who have already finished or are in the process of working their way through it.</p>

    <p>Needless to say there is a LOT of content in there. It will take a lot of time and a lot of motivation.  That is why I am making this site to reach out to anyone else who is interested in attacking this beast as a group.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Is it for you?</h3>
    <p>If you are a total beginner and wondering if it is for you, or if you want a measure of how motivated you truly are, I would recommend taking the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">CodeCademy HTML/CSS</a> course which claims to be 7 hours long. It will take more...</p>  
      
    <p>Take extensive notes in a Word document, practice new code on CodePen.com (a website that allows you to build simple websites and instantly check how they look).  Hopefully you will enjoy it. The Odin Project has you complete this course in one of its early lessons anyway.</p>
    
    <p>This basic website was built using what I learnt from that course.</p>

     <h1>Study Group</h1>
    <p>Social pressure can work as a great motivational tool!  The aim is to have as many people as possible working through the curriculum as possible. </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    
    <p>It is easy to get bogged down with a problem when you are working alone.  Be it a small bug in your first week with HTML; downloading the correct software packages onto your computer; ideas or inspiration for a project to work on.  Chances are that someone has had the exact same problem as you, and if you can find that someone to speak things over with, it will make a big difference. </p>
    
    <h2>Where?</h2>
    
    <p>Bring your laptop, ideas, reasources & suggestions to our weekly co-working meet ups at <a href="http://clickspace.vn/spacebar/">SpaceBar Cafe</a> in Tay Ho, which will help to build a small network of people all working toward the same goal.</p>
